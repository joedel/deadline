Deadline Home Page
============================

This is a distraction free page you can use as your browsers start page.

### Features

A "days left" countdown until a specified date, maybe that 5k you are going to run?

The weather so you know if it's a good time for a walk (uses Wunderground API).

Finally there is a simple todo list which saves to localStorage.


### TODO



- ~~Use localStorage to save todo list~~
- Save weather data so it only hits the API every 10 minutes or so (done but never expires so currently bugged).
- Make the page look awesome
- Make it easier to config in case anyone actually wants to use it
