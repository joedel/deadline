Deadline Home Page

This is a distraction free page you can use as your browsers start page.

It has a countdown until a specified date, maybe that 5k you are going to run, or the big trip you are going to take?

It has the local weather so you know when it's a good time for a walk outside (you will need a free Wunderground API key).

Finally there is a simple todo list, unfortunately it does not save your data at the moment.

TODO:

Use localStorage to save todo list
Cookie the weather so it only hits the API every 10 minutes or so.
Make the page look awesome
Make it easier to config incase anyone actually wants to use it
